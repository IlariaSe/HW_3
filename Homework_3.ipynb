If cycling is not your thing, shared rides are abundant (getme is a good app) as are Car To Go cars. There is also a bus stop less than two blocks from the house, and we are two miles from the Capmetro station at Highland. I-35 is literally a stone's throw from the house, putting you just a few exits from wherever you want to be in Austin. If you are interested, we can provide bike rental services and route recommendations.\\n\\nWe have two dogs, one big and one small. Although we are responsible owners and you will find the house clean, please consider this if you are afraid of dogs or have allergies. On the other hand, if you would like to bring your well-behaved dog, please reach out and we will see if this can be arranged.\\n\\nOur neighborhood connects directly to the Mueller Greenway trails, putting guests less than a mile away from The Thinkery and Mueller Park (they have a great Farmer's Market on Sundays and a beautiful loop for walkers and runners alike).
